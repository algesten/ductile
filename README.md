ductile
=======

Elasticsearch Bulk Loader for quick export/import of bulk formatted data.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install -g ductile
```

## Usage

### Export

```bash
$ ./ductile export --help

 Usage: ductile export [options] <url>

Options:
  --help           Show help  [boolean]
  -d, --delete     output delete operations  [boolean] [default: false]
  -q, --query      file with json query  [string]
  -t, --transform  file with transform function  [string]
```

### Import

```bash
$ ./ductile import --help

 Usage: ductile import [options] <url>

Options:
  --help           Show help  [boolean]
  -d, --delete     change incoming index operations to delete  [boolean] [default: false]
  -t, --transform  file with transform function  [string]
```

## Examples

This tools works with stdin/stdout.

### Export

```bash
$ ductile export http://elastichost:9200/myindex
{"index":{"_index":"myindex","_type":"mytype","_id":"sdltb459b78"}}
{"type":"picture","mimetype":"image/jpeg","representationtype":"complete","pubstatus":"usable","copyrightholder":"Afp","product":[{"code":"FOAFP","nam
...
```

#### To file

```bash
$ ductile export http://elastichost:9200/myindex > dump.bulk
```

#### With type

```bash
$ ductile export http://elastichost:9200/myindex/mytype > dump.bulk
```

#### To delete operations

```bash
$ ./ductile export -d http://devbox.local:9200/myindex
{"delete":{"_index":"myindex","_type":"mytype","_id":"sdltb459b78"}}
{"delete":{"_index":"myindex","_type":"mytype","_id":"sdltb45b7ad"}}
{"delete":{"_index":"myindex","_type":"mytype","_id":"sdltb45b7cc"}}
{"delete":{"_index":"myindex","_type":"mytype","_id":"sdltb45be86"}}
```

#### With a query

Queries are JSON formatted elasticsearch queries. The default query is a `match_all`.
The query file is `require`, so it can also be expressed as `.js` or `.coffee`

```bash
$ ./ductile export -q ./query.json http://devbox.local:9200/dist-sdl-20160314
{"index":{"_index":"myindex","_type":"mytype","_id":"sdltb459b78"}}
{"type":"picture","mimetype":"image/jpeg","representationtype":"complete","pubstatus":"usable","copyrightholder":"Afp","product":[{"code":"FOAFP","nam
```

The `query.json`:

```json
{
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}
```

#### Transform output

Output can optionally be transformed before turned into bulk.
The transform file is `require`, and must produce a function.

```bash
$ ductile export -t ./mytransform.js http://elastichost:9200/myindex/mytype > dump.bulk
```

The `mytransform.js`:

```js
module.exports = function(hit) {
    hit._source.changedvalue = "PANDA!";
    return hit;
};
```

*The function must return the item.* Returning nothing or `null` will
drop the item, and can be used as a programmatic filter.

The input to the function is a hit as produced by elasticsearch.
Any part of the input can be changd.

```json
{
  "_index": "myindex",
  "_type": "mytype",
  "_id": "sdltb459b78",
  "_score": 1,
  "_source": {  }
}
```

## Import

### From an export

```bash
$ ductile export http://host1:9200/myindex1 | ductile import http://host2:9200/myindex2
```

### From a file

```bash
$ ductile import http://elastichost:9200/myindex < dump.bulk
```

### Make delete operations

Index operations can be turned to delete operations.

```bash
$ ductile import -d http://elastichost:9200/myindex < dump-with-index-oper.bulk
```

### Transform input

Input can be optionally transformed. 
The transform file is `require`, and must produce a function.

```bash
$ ductile import -t ./mytransform.js http://elastichost:9200/myindex/mytype < dump.bulk
```

The `mytransform.js`:

```js
module.exports = function(hit) {
    hit._source.changedvalue = "PANDA!";
    return hit;
};
```

*The function must return the item.* Returning nothing or `null` will
drop the item, and can be used as a programmatic filter.

Even though the input is a bulk format, the the input to the function 
is a synthetic hit similar to that produced by elasticsearch searches.
Any part of the input can be changd.

Worth noting is the non-elasticsearch-standard `_oper` field that
will hold one of `index`, `create`, `delete` or `update`.

```json
{
  "_index": "myindex",
  "_type": "mytype",
  "_id": "sdltb459b78",
  "_score": 1,
  "_oper": "index",
  "_source": {  }
}
```
